Mongo-Express-Angular-Node.js-Grunt-CRUD
========================================

This a new version of my MEAN(MONGODB EXPRESS ANGULAR NODEJS) CRUD application based off of Ryan Ford's, but this one is done with a Grunt.js for automated Coffeescript pre-compilation, Minification, and Testing.

To run the application:

1. type 'mongod' to run the mongoDB server.
2. Then run 'Grunt Server', which will automatically compile the Coffeescript files and run the Node.js Files.
